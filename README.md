# Car Power Prediction Model ðŸš—âš¡

A **Machine Learning** model to predict **car horsepower** based on features such as **engine size**, **fuel type**, **transmission**, and other car attributes. This predictive model can be used for estimating a car's power, enabling users to make data-driven decisions in car purchases or evaluations.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes **Linear Regression** to predict a car's horsepower based on a dataset of cars. The model uses a wide range of car features, including but not limited to **Kilometers Driven**, **Engine Size**, **Fuel Type**, **Mileage**, and **Seats**.

The model achieves an impressive **85.16% accuracy** in predicting the horsepower, showing strong potential for real-world applications in the automotive industry, car sales platforms, and vehicle analysis.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the **cars_eda_Analysis.csv** dataset, which includes the following features:

- **Location**: Car's location (not used for prediction)
- **Year**: Year of manufacture
- **Kilometers Driven**: Total kilometers driven by the car
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel (e.g., Petrol, Diesel)
- **Transmission**: Type of transmission (e.g., Manual, Automatic)
- **Owner Type**: Type of ownership
- **Mileage**: Fuel efficiency (km/l)
- **Engine**: Engine size (liters)
- **Power**: Horsepower (target variable)
- **Seats**: Number of seats
- **Brand**: Manufacturer brand
- **Model**: Specific model of the car

## Model Overview

The model is trained using **Linear Regression**, a statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (horsepower) and independent variables (car features).

### Performance Metrics:

- **RÂ² Score**: **0.85** â€“ The model explains 85% of the variance in horsepower predictions.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: **12.74 HP** â€“ On average, the model's predictions are off by 12.74 horsepower.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: **442.47 HP** â€“ The squared difference between predicted and actual horsepower values.
- **Accuracy Percentage**: **85.16%** â€“ The model achieves an impressive 85.16% prediction accuracy.

### Conclusion:

The model is **highly accurate**, with strong predictive power, making it ideal for users seeking insights on car power based on key attributes.

## Features for Prediction:
