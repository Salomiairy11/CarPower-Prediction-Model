## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset includes the following features:

- `make`: Manufacturer of the car.
- `model`: Model of the car.
- `year`: Manufacturing year.
- `mileage`: Distance the car has traveled.
- `engine_size`: Size of the engine in liters.
- `fuel_type`: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel).
- `transmission`: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic).
- `power`: Target variable representing the car's power output in horsepower.
